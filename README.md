Why I need to use Python for ArcGIS?

The ArcMAP is a very powerful tool to generate environmental, geographic, and public health data that could be used in the decision makeing and finding solutions for the environ-health problems. However, it cann't automatically work with multiple jobs in an sequence. But we still need a Big Data dataset and enormous amount of information to reach our study purpose. Then we need an program to save outselves from those processing tasks of thousands input files.

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. It is a perfect combination between python and ArcGIS. With the built-in platform Python-For-ArcGIS, we can process a series of input files in an sequence, without maunally clicking those functions in the ArcMAP.

More tutorials and excieses will be uploaded. Welcome to follow my status on the GitHut if you are also interested in learning GIS programming~



How to use Python for ArcGIS?

First of all, you should install an recent version of ArcGIS for Desktop. And make sure you have the python platform in the window of ArcMAP. The symbol of the python platform is highlighted in the picture below.

Now you can write your python code in the platform!
